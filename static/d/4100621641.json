SPQL's API, along with some utility functions, builds the request up for you behind the scenes and converts the XML response to JSON. SPQL can even perform a number of useful transformations before handing the data back to you (e.g. aliasing, extracting ids and values from lookup/user fields, converting *Multi fields to arrays, or even applying a custom mapper function)."}}]}}}
